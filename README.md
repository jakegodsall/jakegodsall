# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jake

I'm a passionate freelance web developer with a focus on the frontend. I love creating user-friendly and visually appealing web applications. My expertise lies in:

- Building beautiful, responsive, user-friendly UIs with React.js, Next.js, and TailwindCSS.
- Developing robust, efficient, and test-driven server-side code using Python and Django/DRF.
- Effective and efficient database design with RDBMSs (expertise in MySQL).

## ðŸ”¨ What I'm Working On

I am currently working on:
- [GitHub User Search App](https://github.com/jakegodsall/fm-github-user-search-app) - A web frontend for querying the GitHub API for users with useful statistics (Frontend Mentor).
- [Joblisting Web app](https://github.com/jakegodsall/fm-devjobs-web-app](https://github.com/jakegodsall/fm-joblistings-django) - A developer joblisting portal (Frontend Mentor) built with Django.

## ðŸŒ± Learning Journey

I'm currently learning PHP to add to my skillset, enabling me to not only build robust backend services but to be able to do so with a shorter development period.
