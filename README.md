# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jake

I'm a dev who likes to work across the full stack. I like programming and languages and programming languages.

## ðŸ”¨ What I'm Working On

I am currently working on:

- [Reppd](https://github.com/jakegodsall/reppd) - API for a goal setting and progress tracking application. Built with Java 17, Spring Framework 6, and MySQL. I intend to build a web/mobile frontend to this as time allows.

## ðŸŒ± Learning Journey

I am currently dedicating all my efforts to mastering **Java** and **Spring Boot**. My goal is to build really robust and scalable APIs.

Having a blast working through the courses at [Spring Framework Guru](https://springframework.guru/) to build TDD API-driven applications with Spring.
