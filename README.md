# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jake
I'm a passionate full-stack developer who loves building tools that improve not only my life but also the lives of others. 
Whether it's creating educational resources or developing web applications, I'm always eager to work on meaningful projects.

## ðŸ”¨ What I'm Working On
### Current Projects:
- **Flashcard Generator:**
  A comprehensive suite of tools designed to generate language-learning flashcards, leveraging GPT technology and built with Java 22. It includes:
  - [flashcard-generator-core](https://github.com/jakegodsall/flashcard-generator-core): The heart of the system, responsible for generating flashcards.
  - [flashcard-generator-cli](https://github.com/jakegodsall/flashcard-generator-cli): A CLI tool that brings the core functionality to your terminal.
  - RESTful API (private): Provides web-based access to flashcard generation using the core library.
    
- [Dev Jobs Portal](https://github.com/jakegodsall/devjobs_portal):
    A full-stack job portal that allows users to create profiles for clients and companies, post jobs, and apply for positions. Built to streamline the job search process with a clean and responsive interface.

## ðŸŒ± My Learning Journey
Iâ€™m currently participating in the 100 Days of C# Challenge to deepen my knowledge of C# and build real-world projects.

- [Habit Tracker Application](https://github.com/jakegodsall/HabitTrackerCliApp):
A command-line habit tracking tool with full CRUD functionality, SQLite database integration, and basic statistical visualization.

- [Command Line Games](https://github.com/jakegodsall/CommandLineGames):
A fun collection of classic games like Tic-tac-toe and Snake, all implemented in C# for the command line. More games coming soon!
