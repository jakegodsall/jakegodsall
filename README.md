# Hi there! 👋 I'm Jake

I'm a dev who likes to work across the full stack. I like programming and languages and programming languages.

## 🔨 What I'm Working On

I am currently working on:

- [Reppd](https://github.com/jakegodsall/reppd) - API for a goal setting and progress tracking application. Built using TDD with Java 17, Spring Framework 6, and MySQL. I intend to build a web/mobile frontend to this as time allows.
- [Flashcard Generator](https://github.com/jakegodsall/flashcard-generator) - A CLI/GUI tool for generating data for language-learning flashcards with GPT. Built using TDD with Java 22.
- [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/jakegodsall) - Consistently working on Frontend Mentor challenges to keep my frontend skills fresh whilst focusing more on backend. All FM projects in my repositories here are prefixed with `fm-*`.

## 🌱 Learning Journey

I am currently dedicating all my efforts to mastering **Java** and **Spring Boot**. My goal is to build really robust and scalable APIs.

Having a blast working through the courses at [Spring Framework Guru](https://springframework.guru/) to build TDD API-driven applications with Spring.
