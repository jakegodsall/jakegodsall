# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jake

I'm a passionate freelance web developer with a focus on the frontend. I love creating user-friendly and visually appealing web applications. My expertise lies in:

- Building beautiful, responsive, user-friendly UIs with React.js.
- Developing robust, efficient, and test-driven server-side code using Java and Spring Boot.
- Effective and efficient database design with RDBMSs (expertise in MySQL).

## ðŸ”¨ What I'm Working On

I am currently working on [Reppd](https://github.com/jakegodsall/reppd), a full-stack productivity app for tracking daily repetitions of productive habits.

## ðŸŒ± Learning Journey

I'm currently learning PHP to add to my skillset, enabling me to not only build robust backend services with a shorter development period.
