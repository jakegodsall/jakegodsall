# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jake

I'm a dev who likes to work across the full stack. I like to build tools that make my life and the lives of others better.

## ðŸ”¨ What I'm Working On

I am currently working on:

- Flashcard Generator - A suite of tools including a core library ([flashcard-generator-core](https://github.com/jakegodsall/flashcard-generator-core)), a command-line interface ([flashcard-generator-cli](https://github.com/jakegodsall/flashcard-generator-cli)), and a RESTful API (private repository), all built with Java 22 and leveraging GPT to generate language-learning flashcards. The CLI and REST API utilize the core functionality to provide both terminal-based and web-based access to flashcard generation.
- [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/jakegodsall) - Consistently working on Frontend Mentor challenges to keep my frontend skills fresh whilst focusing more on backend. All FM projects in my repositories here are prefixed with `fm-*`.

## ðŸŒ± Learning Journey

I am mostly focusing at present on becoming a better UI designer. To this end I am working on creating intuitive interfaces for the software projects I have already built.

## ðŸ“« Let's Connect!

I'm always open to new opportunities, collaborations, and discussions related to web development. Feel free to reach out to me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/godsalljake/).
